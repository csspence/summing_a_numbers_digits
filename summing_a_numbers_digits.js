/*
Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each of the number's decimal digits. For example:

  sumDigits(10);  // Returns 1
  sumDigits(99);  // Returns 18
  sumDigits(-32); // Returns 5
*/
function sumDigits(number) {
}



//Restate the problem in your own words.
//What are the inputs?
//What are the outputs?
//Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?  Do I already have enough information to solve the problem?  What if you don't have enough information from the user?
//How should you label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
